## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### A little about me

- [School](https://valenciacollege.edu/) - I'm currently attending Valencia College for an AS in Computer Programming and Analysis 
- Fave class so far gotta be _Java_, so I'm really excited to take _Advanced Java_ this semester
- I am originally from Sweden but moved to Florida a couple of years ago to pursue my education
- I'm only here to learn... So for right now I'm sticking to Java but will hopefully get into some other languages soon.
